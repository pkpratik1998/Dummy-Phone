It's a single program(Mini project) to implement mobile phone basic operations like Stopwatch, Phone lock, Call(just process), Message(just process), saving and retrieving Contacts, searching them, Notepads, Tic-Tac-Toe game, Digital watch,etc.

Mini Project in C++ to study File Handling, Computer graphics. Took multiple references for graphics logic but implemented it into this project. I use file handling, C++ object oriented concepts and some computer graphics algorithms in this project. It increased my problem solving abilities.
